This is a series of microbenchmarks I did for some methods of clamping
floating values having min=0 and max being a parameter.

The absolute value based techniques are pretty cool.

Check MY_* files for information on my execution of the benchmarks. The
output of mbench is in MY_RESULTS.

  * MY_PROC_CPUINFO: This has the contents of my `/proc/cpuinfo`.
  * MY_PROC_MEMINFO: This has the contents of my `/proc/meminfo`.
  * MY_GCC-V: This has the output of running `gcc -v`.
  * MY_RESULTS: this has the output of running `./mbench`.
